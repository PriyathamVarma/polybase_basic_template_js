## Getting Started

- Git clone this repo

- npm install

- npm run dev

- node callSchemas.js(in a new terminal)



## File Structure

**Pages**

- Pages are located in the `pages` folder. Each page is a React component.

**APIs**

- APIs are located in the `pages/api` folder. Each API is a serverless function.

**Schemas**

- Schemas are located in the `pages/api/schemas` folder. Each schema is for each collection.

🔹 Step 1: Navigate to /pages/api/schemas directory.

🔹 Step 2: Create a new file (e.g., newFile.jsx) to define the schema.

🔹 Step 3: Add the file name to the apiEndPoints as "/api/schemas/newFile".

🔹 Step 4: Inside newFile.jsx, design the schema as per your requirements, utilizing the available rules and guidelines.

🔹 Step 5: Run the command node callSchemas to deploy the newly created schema.

By following these steps, you can easily create and deploy a new schema for your application. 🚀💡

Remember, defining schemas is an important aspect of maintaining data consistency and structure. Take your time to carefully design the schema based on the specific needs of your application. ✨🔍

Now, let's go ahead and create that new schema! 💪💻
